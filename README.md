## **Assignment Tasks**

You are required to complete the following three analysis tasks using Spark Structured APIs. Ensure that your analysis is well-documented, with clear explanations and any relevant visualizations or summaries.

### **1. Hashtag Trends **

**Objective:**

Identify trending hashtags by analyzing their frequency of use across all posts.

**Tasks:**

- **Extract Hashtags**: Split the `Hashtags` column and flatten it into individual hashtag entries.
- **Count Frequency**: Count how often each hashtag appears.
- **Find Top Hashtags**: Identify the top 10 most frequently used hashtags.


**Expected Outcome:**  
A ranked list of the most-used hashtags and their frequencies.

**Example Output:**

| Hashtag     | Count |
|-------------|-------|
| #social      | 25   |
| #bug         | 24   |
| #love        | 22   |
| #cleanUI     | 22   |
| #mood        | 21   |
| #tech        | 21   |
| #AI          | 20   |
| #UX          | 18   |
| #fail        | 17   |
| #design      | 15   |

### **2. Engagement by Age Group**

**Objective:**  
Understand how users from different age groups engage with content based on likes and retweets.

**Tasks:**

- **Join Datasets**: Combine `posts.csv` and `users.csv` using `UserID`.
- **Group by AgeGroup**: Calculate average likes and retweets for each age group.
- **Rank Groups**: Sort the results to highlight the most engaged age group.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A summary of user engagement behavior categorized by age group.

**Example Output:**

| Age Group | Avg Likes | Avg Retweets |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Senior    | 86.1      | 25.5        |
| Teen      | 71.8      | 15.1        |
| Adult     | 67.0      | 16.9        |

### **3. Sentiment vs Engagement**

**Objective:**  
Evaluate how sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative) influences post engagement.

**Tasks:**

- **Categorize Posts**: Group posts into Positive (`>0.3`), Neutral (`-0.3 to 0.3`), and Negative (`< -0.3`) sentiment groups.
- **Analyze Engagement**: Calculate average likes and retweets per sentiment category.

**Expected Outcome:**  
Insights into whether happier or angrier posts get more attention.

**Example Output:**

| Sentiment | Avg Likes | Avg Retweets |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| Neutral   | 85.3      | 23.0         |
| Negative  | 76.0      | 22.4         |
| Positive  | 75.4      | 23.1         |

### **4. Top Verified Users by Reach**

**Objective:**  
Find the most influential verified users based on their post reach (likes + retweets).

**Tasks:**

- **Filter Verified Users**: Use `Verified = True` from `users.csv`.
- **Calculate Reach**: Sum likes and retweets for each user.
- **Rank Users**: Return top 5 verified users with highest total reach.

**Expected Outcome:**  
A leaderboard of verified users based on audience engagement.

**Example Output:**

| Username       | Total Reach |
|----------------|-------------|
| @critic99      | 1306      |
| @daily_vibes   | 1266      |
